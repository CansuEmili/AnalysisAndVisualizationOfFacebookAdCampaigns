**Analysis and Visualization of Facebook Ad Campaigns**

**Goal:** To analyze daily and campaign-based ad metrics from Facebook to understand the performance and efficiency using key indicators like ROMI (Return on Marketing Investment).

**Method and Tools:** Data processed using Pandas in Jupyter Notebook. Time series analysis, group summaries, and visualizations created. Matplotlib and Seaborn used for plotting. Correlation heatmaps and linear regression used to explore numeric relationships. Graphs include box plots, histograms, lmplot, and heatmaps.

**Results:** Spending more does not always lead to higher ROMI, some campaigns gave high ROMI with low budget.

**Skills Gained:** Time series and group analysis with Pandas, data visualization (Matplotlib, Seaborn), understanding of digital marketing metrics like ROMI, creating insights for business decisions, telling data stories with clear visual charts.
